## **Snowdown Prompts**

Choose ONE prompt below for your team to analyze and answer the guiding questions provided.

## **1️⃣ Do holiday lift ticket discounts drive incremental revenue, or do they primarily cannibalize full-price sales?**

**Guiding Questions**

* How do total lift usage and total revenue on discount days compare to similar non-discount days?

* Are increases in lift usage large enough to offset the lower price per ticket?

* Do discount days show higher downstream spending (rentals, café), or is the effect limited to lift usage?

* How does customer behavior differ on discount days (e.g., runs per skier, time spent skiing)?

* Are certain discounts more effective than others, or do they all behave similarly?

## **2️⃣ Is the membership program net-positive for the resort when accounting for discounts and free lift access?**

**Guiding Questions**

* How does total seasonal revenue from a typical member compare to a typical non-member?

* How much revenue is “lost” per member due to free lift access and discounted café/rental spending?

* Do members visit frequently enough to offset those discounts through higher total spend?

* Which revenue streams (lift, rentals, café) are most affected by membership?

* Are there meaningful differences in behavior between long-tenured members and newer members?

---

## **3️⃣ Based on observed behavior, is the current $2,000 membership price optimal for the resort?**

**Guiding Questions**

* On average, how much revenue does a member generate over a season *excluding* the membership fee?

* At what point does a member “break even” compared to a non-member?

* How sensitive is profitability to changes in the membership price?

* Which assumptions (visit frequency, discount usage, café behavior) most strongly influence your conclusion?

* Would changing the price affect all members equally, or different segments differently?

---

## **4️⃣ Which behaviors or factors are most strongly associated with higher revenue per ski day?**

**Guiding Questions**

* How does revenue per ski day vary with the number of lift runs completed?

* Do customers who rent equipment generate more total revenue than those who do not?

* How does café timing (early vs late purchases) relate to total daily spend?

* Are members or non-members more likely to have high-revenue ski days?

* Are there identifiable thresholds (e.g., runs per day) where revenue changes meaningfully?

---

## **5️⃣ Which days and times create the highest demand across lifts, rentals, and cafés simultaneously?**

**Guiding Questions**

* At what hours of the day do lift usage, rentals, and café transactions peak together?

* How do weekends compare to weekdays in terms of multi-department demand?

* Are holidays characterized by longer peak periods or sharper spikes?

* Do rental pickup times precede lift congestion, and by how much?

* Are there consistent patterns that could inform staffing or operational decisions?
