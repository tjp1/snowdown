/********************************** Prompt 1 **********************************
Do holiday lift ticket discounts drive incremental revenue, or do they primarily cannibalize full-price sales?
*******************************************************************************/

/********************************** Guiding Questions *************************
* How do total lift usage and total revenue on discount days compare to similar non-discount days?
* Are increases in lift usage large enough to offset the lower price per ticket?
* Do discount days show higher downstream spending (rentals, café), or is the effect limited to lift usage?
* How does customer behavior differ on discount days (e.g., runs per skier, time spent skiing)?
* Are certain discounts more effective than others, or do they all behave similarly?
